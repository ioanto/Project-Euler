# Project Euler

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to showcase some Project Euler's problems along with their solutions, as well as document my journey through the collection of problems. Only 

## Technicalities
It is worthwhile to clearly define what is considered a successful solution for this project. For a solution to be considered successful, it must satisfy the following properties:
* The result must be marked as correct by Project Euler.
* As little brute-forcing as possible employed.
* Each solution must require as little computational time as possible, with a top limit of 1 minute.
* Only the Python language must be used.

It is no secret that some problems can be solved entirely on paper without the need for a computer/algorithm. While such approaches are extremely commendable, for this project all solutions will be reached through an (efficient) algorithm.

## Layout

The directory structure for this project is as follows:

```├── README.md                         <-- General project documentation.
├── Problem #X
│   ├── problem_statement.txt         <-- The problem's statement, copied from Project Euler.
│   ├── solution.py                   <-- The Python problem-solving script. Only returns the answer in the desired format.
│   ├── approach.md                   <-- Only found in more complex problems, whose solution (whether theory or implementation) is not very straightforward. For completion's sake.```

## Problem list

The following table provides an easy way to quickly determine if a problem has been solved, abandoned or not yet attempted. If it is successfully completed, it will be marked with a :heavy_check_mark:. If abandoned a :x: will be used. To avoid unnecessary clutter, the table will only contain problems that *have* been attempted. The problem's release and attempt date is also included, in DD/MM/YY format.

| Problem # | Solved | Attempt Date | Release Date |
| :-------: | :----: | :----------: | :----------: |
| 1         | :heavy_check_mark: | 25/12/2023 | 05/10/2001 |
